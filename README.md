## Overlapping-communities-graphs

This repository presents a project a project conducted with Nicolas Jouvin during MSc. MVA at ENS Cachan for the course : Graphs in Machine Learning from Prof. Michal Valko.


The project consisted in writing a report explaining the article "Line Graphs of Weighted Networks for Overlapping Communities"
by Evans and Lambiotte, and implementing their presented algorithm.

We applied it to detect overlapping communities of characters in the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone.
